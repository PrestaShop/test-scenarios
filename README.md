## Test scenarios

This repository documents the test scenarios of the [PrestaShop](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop) software, exported from the internal XRay.

[PrestaShop](https://github.com/PrestaShop/) being an Open Source project, transparency is one of our core values, and it is important for us to make tests accessible to the community.

Our goal is to have clear and structured tests available to all. 

These tests might help:
- developers who want to understand tests which are done to create the build,
- the team maintaining the project, in order to know if and which tests are done on specific parts of the software,
- anyone who is interested in the project and want to know it better.

The repository is maintained by the [Maintainers team](https://github.com/orgs/PrestaShop/teams/prestashop-maintainers/members) and the [QA Functional team](https://github.com/orgs/PrestaShop/teams/qa-functional/members) at PrestaShop.

For the moment not all tests are in this repository. They will be added and synchronized progressively.

You can visit the [PrestaShop](https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop) repository to learn more about the project, the [Developer Documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop.com/1.7/basics/introduction/) and the [user Documentation](https://doc.prestashop.com/).
